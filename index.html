<h1>Hello! I am Ashlee and welcome to my website!</h1>
<section>
    <p>I have learned so much this semester. Coming into this class Fall of 2022, I had no idea what HTML and CSS were. Starting off in this class I was a little bit confused because you start coding right away but, once you start getting the hang of things it begins to become fun. I have been super proud of myself for coming this far in such a challenging class. For me, HTML and CSS were a bit more challenging because getting the codes right on both ends can get a little frustrating if it is not working correctly. Wordpress and Squarespace were a bit easier for me because I got to create a website and desgin it the way I wanted too. I am super happy I got to work on my coding and desgin skills becaise I believe it is a valuable skills for me to have for my marketing field.</p>

    <p>For this final project, I wanted to give some tips and tricks on each of my assignments. I also included two of my assignemnts so I am able to show the work I have done since it is something I am super proud of. Oncce this class comes to an end, I will continue to work of my coding and desgin skills so I cab keep growing. I hope you enjoy this final project I have put together!</p>

        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
